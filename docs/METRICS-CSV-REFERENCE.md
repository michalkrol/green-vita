# METRICS CSV Reference

**Source**: `src/streaming/video/metrics_log.rs:27` — HEADER constant, compiler-enforced `[i64; 99]` array in `write_row()`.
**Total columns**: 99. Order must match the `cols: [i64; 99]` arrays in `write_row()` and `csv_row_from_snapshot()`.
**Scope**: Per-second snapshot drained at `status()` time via `drain_metrics()`. Appended to `ux0:data/xcloud-rust/metrics.csv` at session end.

**Note**: Columns 93–97 appear to be duplicates of earlier columns (22–26), likely from a prior header version or overlapping metric names. The authoritative column count is 97, enforced by the `[i64; 97]` array type.

**Uncertain columns**: If a column's meaning could not be determined from the code + HANDOFF context, it is marked as such. See the "Uncertain Mappings" section in `docs/HUD-REFERENCE.md` for HUD fields with similar treatment.
